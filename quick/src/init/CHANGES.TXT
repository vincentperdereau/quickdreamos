Changes
-------
01.08.2000   Fixed the keymap support. Now all keys are possible to use.
             Changed FUNCTION$API$INKEY: again to fully support special keys
             which are pressed with AltGr+key.
             Changed format of keymap.
             Added support for British and U.S. keyboards.
             The British and U.S. keymap is based on a description which
             i found in the book "The undocumented PC"
             Removed the keyboard$ and keymapfile lines in Init.ASM.
             The keyboard$ and kaymapfile lines are now defined in keydrv.asm
             Added a defination of the keymap format into the keymap files
             Added in Init.ASM a new line (include driver.asm) for CS4235 support.
             Changed the position of the include keydrv.asm. Now it is where
             the load_shell label is. This was needed because when a soundcard
             is found the keydrv.asm routine was ignored.

30.7.2000    First try of keymap support. Not all keys are working.
             Added  include keydrv.asm
             Changed FUNCTION$API$INKEY: routine to support loadable keymaps
             Renamed FrenchKeymap to Keymap.
             Added a name and a number of key line to the keymap 
             French.Asm is the driver file for french keyboards
             German.Asm is the driver file for german keyboards
             Added this two lines at the end of Init.ASM
              keyboard$              DB      LF,CR,"keyboard:",0
              keymapfile             DB      "/lib/kbd/keymap",0
